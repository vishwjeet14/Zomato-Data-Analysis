## Introduction

* This README describes work done on the Zomato data set for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module assessment due 21 April 2022. Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy . These packages all come as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python.

* The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and start Jupyter notebook in the folder containing the file. Use the command Jupyter notebook on the command line.

* Alternatively, view a static version of the notebook (by providing its GitHub url) using Jupyter Nbviewer.

* The Zomato data set is downloaded from kaggle. It contain to Files one is CSV and other is Excel. Both the file are related to each other and connected with attribute called Country code.

* I have tried to structure the Jupyter notebook and this README so that they have corresponding sections. However, I do not wish to merely repeat here what has been stated in the notebook. I will endeavour to have this README summarize the work of the notebook and, hopefully, complement the analyses done there.
